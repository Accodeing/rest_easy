# Why this library is under dual licenses (GPL v3 or commercial)

We belive in free and open software, that is why this library is available under GPL v3. As long as you are prepared to give your derived works away for free under a compatible licence we are perfectly happy to let you build on our for free as well. Together we will make the world a little bit better :)

If you need to use this library in a way that is incompatible with the GPL v3 licence, most notably in a commercial product where you will not or can not publish the derived works under a compatible licence, that is fine too. We do a lot of commercial work and it is not always possible to get permission to release parts as open source. In that instance we do however feel that since the company is benefitting directly from our work, by not having to pay their developers to implement this part of their solution, it is not reasonable to give our time away anymore. The company will make money off of their produce and then they should give us money for aiding them.

Indirectly this is a tax on their unwillingness to contribute to the open source ecosystem and we will use any funds we receive from such licences to further our work in open source on your behalf. So it won't go to luxury cars, but give us a few more hours of giving back to the community that basically enable our entire industry to exist in its current form.

Accodeing to you will always detail the time and money aspects of our open source work on our site. So go to https://accodeing.com/open-source to see what we do with our time and any money we get.
