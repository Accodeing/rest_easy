# Roadmap

## v0.1.0

* [x] Migrate boilerplate code from the [Fortnox API gem](https://github.com/my-codeworks/fortnox-api) to new repo.
* [ ] Add support for middleware to allow for the token management needed for the Fortnox API.
* [ ] Add tests to verify all built in types as well as subclassing of the base classes.
* [ ] Integrate into the Fortnox API gem and ship a first production version.
* [ ] Build the Ratsit API abstraction on the same version to assess viability.

## v0.2.0

* [ ] Evaluate internal design choices and public API design.
* [ ] Also take the planned sister SOAP boilerplate gem into account, we want the public API and feel of the two gems to be very close.
